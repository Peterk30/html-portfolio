<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, I am Peter Karnezis and I am (trying to be) a web developer. I'm very new to this, but I'm excited to start this journey and learn new things.
  I know given the chance to continue learning through courses or on-the-job-experience that I can quickly adapt and learn how to become a professional web developer.
